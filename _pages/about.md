My name is Jinguo Sun. I am a postdoc in Division of combustion physics at Lund University, Sweden.

I received my Bachelor (June, 2017) and Ph.D. (June, 2022) degrees from Department of Energy and Power Engineering at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

My current work focuses on plasma-assisted ammonia combustion and non-equilibrium plasma physics, and advanced laser diagnostics.
